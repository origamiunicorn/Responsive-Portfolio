# Responsive-Portfolio
Link to live website: https://origamiunicorn.github.io/Responsive-Portfolio/

This Responsive Portfolio is a modified version of the Basic-Portfolio as seen here (https://github.com/origamiunicorn/Basic-Portfolio). This was another class project, with the aim of taking the non-responsive code of our Basic Portfolios and adapting it to be responsive at three different breakpoints: 980px, 768px, and 640px.

Using media queries, I was able to write CSS to make the website content adapt at each breakpoint to reflect a series of images (related to the breakpoints as seen on each page) provided to us. This is all part of a homework assignment for UCLA's Fullstack Web Development Coding Bootcamp (September 2019 to March 2020).

## Languages Used
* CSS3
* HTML5

## Features
The use of CSS Grid to create a custom layout following the visual given in the UCLA Coding Bootcamp homework and the addition of media queries at three different breakpoints in order to create a responsive website viewable on different screen sizes.
