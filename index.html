          Rachael Wright is a freelance web developer currently enrolled in UCLA's Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp. Passionate about presentation and functionality of websites for both users and clients, she's enthusiastic about the continual process of learning involved with a field undergoing constant change.

          Being interested in website development since her pre-teen years, Rachael started out in the annals of history coding table layouts on Geocities before graduating to customising pages on Social Media sites and journaling sites, as well as designing simple, for-fun generators for collaborative online community art projects. She's since written code snippets for a variety of social platforms, as well as written a few bots for Discord, including one which randomly offers quotes from Ridley Scott's <em>Gladiator</em> (2000 film).

          Outside of coding, she loves photography, hiking, working with animals, and traveling to visit friends around the world. She may or may not also enjoy sitting next to raptors at Renaissance Faires.
